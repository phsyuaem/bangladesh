I, on behalf of Bangladeshi students, want to keep you an eye on Bangladesh. We are killed by our ruling govt. party because of our quota movements for our rights. After killing a lot of students, our PM is trying to go to your country as well as some other countries and escaping her responsibility. No media, channels and newspaper is helping us to show the real truth because of our govt. order. Also the service holder like police are firing against the students and people as they are ordered to do that by our merciless govt. We want you to see the news and scenes in social media like facebook, X and spread the news of Bangladesh everywhere. Already a lot of international news community helped us to do it. We want you to not accept her in your country. Please help us to get our right. Here are some prove for you about the movements going on in Bangladesh.

Sincerely,

Name

On behalf of the students of Bangladesh`);
